# Abstract
Mesh networking is a new networking paradigm that is intended to help mitigate the effects of an increasing number of devices connected to the Internet. Whilst Segment routing is a method in a mesh network, which allows a packet source to enforce a topological path through a network. Segment routing in IPv6 has been applied to large-scale IP, but has not yet been tested widely onIPv6 over Low Powered Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) mesh networks. 


# Approach 
**Aim:** Construct a small sensor mesh network and demonstrate Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) segment routing's ability to cope with topology changes using the Open Source Contiki OS and low-level C software. 
-Develop IP packets decoder and designing the framework for segment routing in IPv6 over Low Powered Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN).
-Implement Segment and test segment routing and RPL on the OpenMote-cc2538. The results of the testing, are used to benchmark both RPL and Segment in the 802.15.4 wireless environment and provide meaning data to the community to direct future development work.
