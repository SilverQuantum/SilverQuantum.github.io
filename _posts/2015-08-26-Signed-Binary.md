# Abstract
We perform not just any binary arithmetic calculation, but also signed binary through USB terminal. We utilize USB terminal because unlike the Zybo board, the terminal doesn’t have limited push buttons or slide switches making it more suitable for the project. We’ll be able to use keyboards keystroke to take in input, and then view the arithmetic calculation right away on the terminal, similar to using a hand calculator.
