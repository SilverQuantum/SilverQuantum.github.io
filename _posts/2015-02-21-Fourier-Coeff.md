# Abstract
We simulate a system where an input of a sinusoid is provided to a saturation block and the output is connected to a spectrum analyzer. The results from the spectrum analyzer for harmonics n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are converted to polar magnitude and then compared to the ones obtained by doing manual calculations on the output signal (saturated signal)
