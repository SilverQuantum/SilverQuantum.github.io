# Abstract
We are to investigate the bit error rate for binary phase shift keyed system with phase distortion and examined the BER performance against its theoretical performance. We investigate the bit rate error (BER) performance for a binary phase shift keyed (BPSK) digital communication system with a non-ideal phase deviation Delta phi.
