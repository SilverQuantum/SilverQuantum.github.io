# Abstract
This will guide through the process of creating a first Zynq design using the Vivado Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and introduce the IP Integrator environment for a simple Zynq processor design to be implemented on a Zynq development board. The Software Development Kit (SDK) will then be used to create a simple software application, which will run on the Zynqâ€™s ARM Processing System (PS) to control the hardware that is implemented in the Programmable Logic (PL).
